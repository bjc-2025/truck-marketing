      question: "How quickly can PPC campaigns start generating leads?",
      answer: "PPC campaigns can start generating leads within 24-48 hours of launch. Unlike SEO, paid ads provide immediate visibility, making them perfect for trucking companies that need leads quickly or want to test new markets."

    {
      question: "What's a good budget to start with for trucking PPC?",
      answer: "Most successful trucking PPC campaigns start with $2,000-5,000 per month, depending on your target markets and competition. We optimise spending to focus on your most profitable lanes and freight types for maximum ROI."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you target ads to specific shipping lanes?",
      answer: "Yes! We create highly targeted campaigns for specific routes like 'Chicago to Los Angeles trucking' or 'Northeast freight shipping'. This ensures your ads reach shippers with loads on your preferred lanes."
